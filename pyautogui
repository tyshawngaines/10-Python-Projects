pyautogui allows you to automate things:
trust me this is very useful.
ever heard of a bot? you can make one with it once you understand the basic.

With pyautogui you can program you computer to do stuff you can do yourself.
I have a second computer at home that sends a random good morning to friends and family to facebook at a random time between 8am-8:59am.
I have also used it to watch videos online all day and get paid to do it for me because I have more important things to do.
you get it?

to get started you need to get pyautogui on your computer

heres a basic code: to make it turn on your media player
'''

import pyautogui, time

pyautogui.press('win')
time.sleep(5)
pyautogui.typewrite('windows media player')
time.sleep(5)
pyautogui.press('enter')

'''
sometimes you have to fish around just to get pyautogui installed and running
but once it is running let you mind have some fun! :)
